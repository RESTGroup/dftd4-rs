# AI Code Agent rules

## Git Commit Convention

- For co-author, please add AI agent and model name as co-author.
  - Multi-co-author format (note no extra newline between co-authors):
    ```
    Co-authored-by: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>
    Co-authored-by: glm-5.1 <service@zhipuai.cn>
    ```
  - First co-author: Agent
    - Claude Code: noreply@anthropic.com
  - Second co-author: Model
    - qwen* (eg. qwen3.5-plus): qianwen_opensource@alibabacloud.com
    - glm* (eg. glm-5.1): service@zhipuai.cn
    - minimax* (eg. MiniMax-M2.5): model@minimax.io
    - deepseek* (eg. DeepSeek-V3.2): service@deepseek.com
    - kimi* (eg. kimi-k2.5): growth@moonshot.cn
    - doubao* (eg. doubao-seed-2.0-code): doubao-llm@bytedance.com
  - Model name should include the version or details, such as `qwen3.5-plus`, `glm-5.1`, which can be inferred by Claude Code's `/model` property.

- You should not git commit by yourself, even you are in bypass mode. Please return the code changes to the user, and let the user decide whether to commit or not.
